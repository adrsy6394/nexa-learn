This means you can specify how operators like +, -, *, etc., behave when applied to objects of your classes.\n   - **Example**: You can overload the + operator to add two objects of a class together.\n\n2. **Dynamic Binding**: Dynamic binding (or late binding) is a mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time. This is a key feature of polymorphism in OOP.\n   - **Example**: If you have a base class pointer pointing to a derived class object, the correct overridden method will be called based on the actual object type at runtime.`,

              answer: `## Tokens, Identifiers, Keywords, Variables, Constants\nIn C++, the basic building blocks of the language include tokens, identifiers, keywords, variables, and constants. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Tokens**: Tokens are the smallest elements in a program that are meaningful to the compiler. They include keywords, identifiers, constants, operators, and punctuation.\n2. **Identifiers**: Identifiers are names given to entities such as variables, functions, classes, etc. They must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, digits, and underscores.\n3. **Keywords**: Keywords are reserved words in C++ that have special meaning to the compiler (e.g., int, float, if, else). They cannot be used as identifiers.\n4. **Variables**: Variables are named storage locations in memory that can hold data values. They must be declared before use.\n5. **Constants**: Constants are fixed values that do not change during program execution. They can be defined using the const keyword or by using literal values.`,

Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Basic Data Types**: These include fundamental types such as int (integer), float (floating-point), double (double-precision floating-point), char (character), and bool (boolean).\n2. **Arrays**: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. It can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional.\n3. **Strings**: C++ provides a string class for handling sequences of characters. Strings can be manipulated using various member functions.\n4. **User-defined Data Types**: C++ allows the creation of user-defined data types using classes, structures, unions, and enumerations.

C++ supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise, assignment, and more.\n2. **Type Conversions**: Type conversion is the process of converting a value from one data type to another. C++ supports both implicit and explicit type conversions.\n   - **Implicit Conversion**: The compiler automatically converts one data type to another (e.g., int to float) when required.\n   - **Explicit Conversion**: The programmer manually converts a data type using casting operators (e.g., static_cast, dynamic_cast).`,

              answer: `## Control Statements: if, switch, loops (for, while, do-while)\nControl statements in C++ allow for decision-making and looping. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **if Statement**: The if statement evaluates a condition and executes a block of code if the condition is true.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   if (age > 18) {\n       cout << "Adult";\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n2. **switch Statement**: The switch statement allows multi-way branching based on the value of an expression.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   switch (day) {\n       case 1:\n           cout << "Monday";\n           break;\n       case 2:\n           cout << "Tuesday";\n           break;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n3. **Loops**: C++ supports various loop constructs for repeated execution:\n   - **for Loop**: Used for iterating a specific number of times.\n     - **Example**: \n     \`\`\`\n     for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n         cout << i;\n     }\n     \`\`\`\n   - **while Loop**: Repeats a block of code while a condition is true.\n     - **Example**: \n     \`\`\`\n     while (count < 5) {\n         cout << count;\n         count++;\n     }\n     \`\`\`\n   - **do-while Loop**: Similar to while, but guarantees at least one execution.\n     - **Example**: \n     \`\`\`\n     do {\n         cout << count;\n         count++;\n     } while (count < 5);\n     \`\`\``,

              answer: `## Functions: Declaration, Calling, Pass by Value, Return Types\nFunctions in C++ are blocks of code that perform a specific task. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Declaration**: A function must be declared before it can be called. The declaration includes the function's name, return type, and parameters.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   int add(int a, int b);\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Calling**: A function is called by using its name followed by parentheses. Arguments can be passed to the function within the parentheses.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   int result = add(5, 10);\n   \`\`\`\n3. **Pass by Value**: In C++, function arguments are passed by value by default. This means a copy of the argument is made, and changes to the parameter do not affect the original argument.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   void increment(int x) {\n       x++;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n4. **Return Types**: Functions can return a value using the return statement. The return type must match the function's declared return type.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   int add(int a, int b) {\n       return a + b;\n   }\n   \`\`\``,

              answer: `## Inline Functions, Default Arguments, Pointers (basic use)\n1. **Inline Functions**: Inline functions are defined using the inline keyword. They are expanded in line when called, which can improve performance by eliminating function call overhead.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   inline int square(int x) {\n       return x * x;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Default Arguments**: C++ allows functions to have default arguments. If a caller omits an argument, the default value is used.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   void display(int x, int y = 10) {\n       cout << "X: " << x << ", Y: " << y;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n3. **Pointers**: Pointers are variables that store memory addresses.

              answer: `## Class and Object Declaration, Member Functions\nIn C++, classes are used to define user-defined data types. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Class Declaration**: A class is declared using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a body enclosed in braces. The body contains data members (attributes) and member functions (methods).\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   class Car {\n   public:\n       string brand;\n       int year;\n       void display() {\n           cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year;\n       }\n   };\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Object Declaration**: An object is an instance of a class.

              answer: `## Copy Constructor: Shallow vs Deep Copy\nA copy constructor is a special constructor that initializes an object using another object of the same class. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Shallow Copy**: A shallow copy creates a new object but copies the values of the data members directly. If the data members are pointers, both objects will point to the same memory location.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   Car(const Car& c) {\n       brand = c.brand;\n       year = c.year;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Deep Copy**: A deep copy creates a new object and allocates separate memory for any dynamically allocated data members, ensuring that changes to one object do not affect the other.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   Car(const Car& c) {\n       brand = c.brand;\n       year = c.year;\n       // If there were dynamic memory allocations, allocate new memory here.\n   }\n   \`\`\``,

This ensures that the base class is properly initialized before the derived class.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   class Base {\n   public:\n       Base() { cout << "Base Constructor"; }\n   };\n\n   class Derived : public Base {\n   public:\n       Derived() { cout << "Derived Constructor"; }\n   };\n\n   int main() {\n       Derived d; // Output: Base Constructor Derived Constructor\n       return 0;\n   }\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Overriding Member Functions**: A derived class can override a base class member function by defining a function with the same name and signature. The base class function can be called using the scope resolution operator (::).\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   class Base {\n   public:\n       virtual void display() { cout << "Base Display"; }\n   };\n\n   class Derived : public Base {\n   public:\n       void display() override { cout << "Derived Display"; }\n   };\n\n   int main() {\n       Base* b = new Derived();\n       b->display(); // Output: Derived Display\n       delete b;\n       return 0;\n   }\n   \`\`\``,

              answer: `## Abstract Base Class and Virtual Functions\nAn abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is used to define an interface for derived classes. Here are the key points:\n\n1. **Abstract Base Class**: A class becomes abstract when it contains at least one pure virtual function, which is declared by appending = 0 to the function declaration.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   class Shape {\n   public:\n       virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function\n   };\n   \`\`\`\n2. **Virtual Functions**: Virtual functions allow derived classes to override base class methods. They enable dynamic binding, meaning the method that gets called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.\n   - **Example**: \n   \`\`\`\n   class Circle : public Shape {\n   public:\n       void draw() override { cout << "Drawing Circle"; }\n   };\n\n   int main() {\n       Shape* s = new Circle();\n       s->draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle\n       delete s;\n       return 0;\n   }\n   \`\`\``,

              answer: `## Database Normalization

Database normalization is a systematic process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves decomposing larger tables into smaller, well-structured tables following certain rules called normal forms.

1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**:  
   - A relation is in 1NF if it contains only atomic (indivisible) values and each record is unique.  
   - **Rule**: No multivalued or repeating attributes.  
   - **Example**: A student table with one column for multiple phone numbers violates 1NF.

2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**:  
   - A relation is in 2NF if it is in 1NF and there is no partial dependency.  
   - **Rule**: Every non-prime attribute must be fully functionally dependent on the **entire** primary key.  
   - **Example**: If a table has composite key (RollNo, Subject) → Marks, then student name depending only on RollNo violates 2NF.

3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**:  
   - A relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and there is no transitive dependency.  
   - **Rule**: Non-prime attributes should depend only on the primary key, not on other non-prime attributes.  
   - **Example**: If RollNo → Dept and Dept → HOD, then HOD depends transitively on RollNo.

4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**:  
   - An advanced version of 3NF that removes anomalies not handled by 3NF.  
   - **Rule**: For every functional dependency X → Y, X should be a candidate key.  
   - **Example**: If a table has dependency like Teacher → Subject and Subject → Teacher, and both are not candidate keys, BCNF is violated.

5. **4NF (Fourth Normal Form)**:  
   - A relation is in 4NF if it is in BCNF and has no multi-valued dependencies.  
   - **Rule**: Multivalued dependencies must be removed.  
   - **Example**: If a student can have multiple hobbies and multiple phone numbers independently, it should be split into separate tables.

6. **5NF (Fifth Normal Form)**:  
   - A relation is in 5NF if it is in 4NF and has no join dependency.  
   - **Rule**: Every join dependency should be implied by candidate keys.  
   - **Example**: Complex data scenarios requiring join operations that result in redundancy if not properly normalized.

Relational algebra is a procedural query language used to query relational databases. It uses various operators to manipulate relations (tables) and produce desired results.

1. **Select (σ)**: 
   - Used to select rows that satisfy a given predicate (condition).
   - Example: σ_age > 18(Students) → selects students older than 18.

2. **Project (π)**: 
   - Used to select specific columns from a table.
   - Example: π_name, age(Students) → returns only name and age columns.

3. **Union (∪)**: 
   - Combines the tuples of two relations and eliminates duplicates.
   - Example: A ∪ B → returns all unique rows from A and B.

4. **Set Difference (−)**: 
   - Returns tuples that are in one relation but not in the other.
   - Example: A − B → returns tuples in A but not in B.

5. **Cartesian Product (×)**: 
   - Combines every tuple of one relation with every tuple of another relation.
   - Example: A × B → produces a new relation with all combinations of A and B.

6. **Join (⨝)**: 
   - Combines tuples from two relations based on a common attribute.

Tuple Relational Calculus is a non-procedural query language that describes what result you want, rather than how to compute it. It uses tuple variables to represent rows of a table.

1. **Syntax**: { t | P(t) }
   - Here, 't' is a tuple variable and 'P(t)' is a predicate (condition) that the tuple must satisfy.

2. **Tuple Variable**:
   - A variable that represents a tuple (row) in a relation.
   - It ranges over all tuples in a relation.

3. **Predicate (P(t))**:
   - A logical condition that must be true for a tuple to be selected.
   - Can include comparisons, logical operators (AND, OR, NOT), and quantifiers (∃, ∀).

4. **Example**:
   - { t | t ∈ Student AND t.age > 18 }
   - This returns all tuples t from the Student relation where the age is greater than 18.

5. **Non-Procedural Nature**:

Domain Relational Calculus is a non-procedural query language that focuses on domain variables, which take values from the attributes (columns) of a relation, rather than entire tuples.

1. **Syntax**: { <x, y, z, ...> | P(x, y, z, ...) }
   - Each variable represents a single domain (i.e., an attribute value), not a full row.

2. **Domain Variables**:
   - Variables that range over single values in the domain of attributes.
   - Unlike TRC which uses tuple variables, DRC uses individual attribute variables.

3. **Predicate (P)**:
   - A logical condition that the domain variables must satisfy.
   - Can include comparison operators (=, <, >, etc.), logical connectors (AND, OR, NOT), and quantifiers (∃, ∀).

4. **Example**:
   - { <n> | ∃ a ∃ g (Student(n, a, g) ∧ g = "A") }
   - This returns the names (n) of students who have grade "A".

5. **Non-Procedural Nature**:
   - Focuses on describing **what** result is desired, without specifying **how** to obtain it.

   - Example: SELECT name FROM Students WHERE grade = 'A';

2. **Portable & Interactive**:
   - SQL queries can be used across various database systems (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) with minimal changes.
   - It can be used interactively through command-line interfaces or database tools to query and manage data in real-time.

3. **Supports DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
   - Used to define and manage database structures.
   - Examples: CREATE, ALTER, DROP.

4. **Supports DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:
   - Used to manipulate data within tables.
   - Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.

5. **Supports DCL (Data Control Language)**:
   - Used to control access to data.

SQL commands are categorized into different types based on their purpose in managing databases:

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**:
   - Used to define and modify database structures such as tables and schemas.
   - Commands:
     - **CREATE**: Creates a new table or database.
     - **ALTER**: Modifies an existing database object like a table.
     - **DROP**: Deletes objects like tables or databases.
   - Example: 
     \`\`\`sql
     CREATE TABLE Students (id INT, name VARCHAR(100));
     \`\`\`

2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**:
   - Used to manipulate the data stored in the database.
   - Commands:
     - **INSERT**: Adds new data.
     - **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data.
     - **DELETE**: Removes data.
   - Example:
     \`\`\`sql
     INSERT INTO Students (id, name) VALUES (1, 'Adarsh');
     \`\`\`

3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**:
   - Deals with rights, permissions, and access control.
   - Commands:
     - **GRANT**: Gives user access privileges.
     - **REVOKE**: Removes user access privileges.
   - Example:
     \`\`\`sql
     GRANT SELECT ON Students TO user1;
     \`\`\`

4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**:
   - Manages transactions and the changes made by DML statements.
   - Commands:
     - **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the current transaction.
     - **ROLLBACK**: Undoes changes made in the current transaction.
   - Example:
     \`\`\`sql
     COMMIT;
     \`\`\`

These commands work together to manage database structure, data, permissions, and transactions efficiently.`,

              topic: `SQL Data Types:
   - INT, VARCHAR, DATE, FLOAT, BOOLEAN`,
              answer: `## SQL Data Types

SQL provides a variety of data types to define the kind of data that can be stored in a column. Here are some commonly used data types:

1. **INT (Integer)**:
   - Stores whole numbers (both positive and negative).
   - Example: \`INT\` can store values like 1, -5, 1000.

2. **VARCHAR(n) (Variable Character)**:
   - Stores variable-length text strings up to 'n' characters.
   - Example: \`VARCHAR(100)\` can store names like 'Adarsh Yadav'.

3. **DATE**:
   - Stores calendar dates (Year-Month-Day format).
   - Example: \`DATE\` can store '2025-07-27'.

4. **FLOAT / DOUBLE**:
   - Stores real numbers with decimal points.
   - \`FLOAT\` is used for single-precision, \`DOUBLE\` for double-precision.
   - Example: 10.5, 3.14159

5. **BOOLEAN**:
   - Stores true/false values.
   - Example: \`BOOLEAN\` can store \`TRUE\` or \`FALSE\`.

### Example Table:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
  id INT,
  name VARCHAR(100),
  price FLOAT,
  available BOOLEAN,
  manufactured_date DATE
);
\`\`\`

Each column in SQL must be assigned a suitable data type based on the type of data it will store. Choosing correct data types helps in optimizing storage and performance.`,

              topic: `SQL Operators:
   - Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
   - Comparison: =, <>, >, <
   - Logical: AND, OR, NOT
   - Operator precedence matters in complex queries`,
              answer: `## SQL Operators

SQL provides various types of operators used in queries to perform operations on data. These include arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
Used to perform mathematical operations on numeric data.
- \`+\` (Addition): Adds two numbers
- \`-\` (Subtraction): Subtracts second number from the first
- \`*\` (Multiplication): Multiplies two numbers
- \`/\` (Division): Divides first number by the second

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT price + 10 AS increased_price FROM products;
\`\`\`

---

### 2. **Comparison Operators**:
Used to compare two values.
- \`=\` : Equal to
- \`<>\` or \`!=\` : Not equal to
- \`>\` : Greater than
- \`<\` : Less than

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
\`\`\`

---

### 3. **Logical Operators**:
Used to combine multiple conditions.
- \`AND\` : True if both conditions are true
- \`OR\` : True if at least one condition is true
- \`NOT\` : Reverses the result of a condition

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18 AND grade = 'A';
\`\`\`

---

### 4. **Operator Precedence**:
- SQL follows a precedence order when multiple operators are used.
- **Order**: Arithmetic > Comparison > Logical
- Use **parentheses** to control evaluation order in complex queries.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE (price > 100 OR quantity > 10) AND status = 'shipped';
\`\`\`

Using correct operators and understanding their precedence is essential for writing accurate SQL queries.`,

   - SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition;
   - Subqueries: Nested SELECT statements`,
              answer: `## SQL Queries

SQL queries are used to retrieve specific data from one or more tables in a database. The most common query is the **SELECT** statement.

---

### 1. **Basic SELECT Query**:
Used to retrieve data from a table based on specified conditions.

🔹 **Syntax**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
\`\`\`

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name, age FROM students WHERE age > 18;
\`\`\`

---

### 2. **Subqueries (Nested SELECT Statements)**:
A subquery is a query inside another query. It is used to perform intermediate calculations or filtering.

🔹 **Syntax**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM another_table WHERE condition);
\`\`\`

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE dept_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM departments WHERE name = 'Sales'
);
\`\`\`

---

              topic: `Joins:
   - INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN`,
              answer: `## SQL Joins

Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

---

### 1. **INNER JOIN**
Returns only matching rows from both tables.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
\`\`\`

---

### 2. **LEFT JOIN** (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
Returns all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table. If no match, NULLs are shown for right table.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
\`\`\`

---

### 3. **RIGHT JOIN** (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

              topic: `Set Operations:
   - UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS (Note: MINUS is Oracle specific)`,
              answer: `## SQL Set Operations

Set operations allow you to combine results from multiple SELECT queries.

---

### 1. **UNION**
Combines results of two queries and removes duplicates.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name FROM students
UNION
SELECT name FROM alumni;
\`\`\`

---

### 2. **UNION ALL**
Same as UNION but includes duplicate values.

🔹 **Example**:

SELECT name FROM students
UNION ALL
SELECT name FROM alumni;
\`\`\`

---

### 3. **INTERSECT**
Returns only the common rows from both queries.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM alumni;
\`\`\`

---

### 4. **MINUS** (Oracle specific)
Returns rows from the first query that are not in the second.

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
SELECT name FROM students
MINUS
SELECT name FROM alumni;
\`\`\`

   - View: Virtual table using CREATE VIEW
   - Index: Improves query speed`,
              answer: `## Views & Indexes

---

### 1. **View**
A **view** is a virtual table created from a SELECT query. It doesn't store data itself, but presents data from one or more tables.

🔹 **Syntax**:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
\`\`\`

🔹 **Example**:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE VIEW active_students AS
SELECT name, course
FROM students
WHERE status = 'active';
\`\`\`

🔹 **Use Cases**:
- Simplify complex queries
- Provide limited access to data
- Enhance security by hiding sensitive columns

---

### 2. **Index**
An **index** is used to speed up search operations on a database table. It's similar to an index in a book.

🔹 **Syntax**:
\`\`\`sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column1, column2);
\`\`\`

🔹 **Types**:
- **Single-column index**
- **Composite index (multi-column)**
- **Unique index**

🔹 **Benefits**:
- Faster SELECT queries
- Optimizes WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses

🔹 **Note**:
- Indexes improve read speed but may slow down INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE because indexes must be updated.

   - Used for row-by-row processing`,
              answer: `## Cursors in SQL

---

### 🔹 What is a Cursor?

A **cursor** is a database object used to retrieve and process rows one at a time from a result set. It is useful when you need to perform operations on each row individually (row-by-row processing).

---

### 🔹 When to Use a Cursor?

- When a SQL query returns multiple rows but you want to process each row separately.
- Used mostly in **stored procedures** or **PL/SQL blocks**.

---

### 🔹 Cursor Types:

1. **Implicit Cursor**  
   - Automatically created by SQL when a SELECT INTO or DML statement is executed.
2. **Explicit Cursor**  
   - Defined by the programmer for more control over the row processing.

---

### 🔹 Steps to Use an Explicit Cursor:

1. **Declare the Cursor**
\`\`\`sql
CURSOR cursor_name IS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
\`\`\`

2. **Open the Cursor**
\`\`\`sql
OPEN cursor_name;
\`\`\`

3. **Fetch the Data**
\`\`\`sql
FETCH cursor_name INTO variable1, variable2;
\`\`\`

4. **Close the Cursor**
\`\`\`sql
CLOSE cursor_name;
\`\`\`

---

### 🔹 Example:

\`\`\`sql
DECLARE
  CURSOR emp_cursor IS SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
  v_name employees.name%TYPE;
  v_salary employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN emp_cursor;
  LOOP
    FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_name, v_salary;
    EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name: ' || v_name || ', Salary: ' || v_salary);
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
\`\`\`

---

 **Tip**: Use cursors only when necessary. For most operations, **set-based SQL** is faster and more efficient.
